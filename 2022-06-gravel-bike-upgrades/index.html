Well, we upgraded my gravel bike "Candy" to be a _MUCH_ better climbing bike (really we turned it from a "cyclocross" bike to a super-light gravel bike).  After upgrading the tires, we upgraded the rear cassette (and derailleur) and front chainring.

Hunter figured out Shimano GRX, with a
[longer GRX derailleur](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/grx-11-speed/RD-RX812.html),
could take a _much bigger_ rear cassette, all the way from 34 tooth biggest gear to 46T:

We also made the front chainring smaller, from 40T stock to 36T:

Candy now has the same ["gain ratio"](/gears) in its easiest setup:
- [46T (rear) + 36T front](/gears/?36/11-13-15-17-19-21-24-28-32-37-46) -- which climbs the same as:
- [51T (rear) + 40T front](/gears/?40/11-13-15-18-21-24-28-33-39-45-51)
:)

And, *wow* [she can climb](../gravel-race-lost-and-found-sierra-tahoe/) now.
